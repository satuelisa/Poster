\section{Introduction}

I worked on some stuff.

\section{Background}

It was relevant stuff. 

\section{Related work}

Other people worked on it, too, before I did, like for example
\citet{elisa}. Those people are extra smart, but there are still
aspects that can be improved.

\section{Proposed solution}

I came up with this idea.

\section{Evaluation}

It kinda worked.

\section{Conclusions}

I would like to publish this.
